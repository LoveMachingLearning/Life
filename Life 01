Don't be naively optimistic about helping others get rich. 

Don't easily give the weak opportunities. Adults can only choose, they can't be educated.Â 

Your naivety and goodwill are not necessarily appreciated by others. 

They will only take it for granted. And as long as you make one mistake, they may even despise you and hate you.
