A person's life is like a small boat floating on the ocean, bobbing among the huge waves and storms.

Each of us is a unique individual, yet also a member of the human race. In the long journey of life, we experience love, hatred, tears, and laughter, and taste the sweet, sour, bitter and spicy.

We strive for our ideals, work hard for our families, and get entangled in complex relationships. We learn independence while growing up, and find our place in society. We taste the joys of success, and the pains of failure. We march on positively, but also wander aimlessly.

We embrace the vigor of youth, the stability of middle age, and the serenity of old age. Life has sorrows as deep as the ocean, yet also joys as bright as the sun. As time slips by, our hair turns white, we look back on our journey, and appreciate the wonder and beauty of life.

We come from dust, and to dust we shall return, yet the fire of life never dies.
