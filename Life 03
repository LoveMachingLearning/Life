Life has its ups and downs, tears and laughter. Each of our fates is like a boat sailing on the endless river, sometimes with favorable wind and tide, sometimes against.

Life's vicissitudes are like the changing of day and night, both light and darkness visit in turns.When standing at the peak, do not forget the pain from falling into the abyss. When in the depths of darkness, keep the courage and faith to climb back up.

Day after day, we face life's uncertainty, only by moving forward constantly. Through tribulations, we grow strong; through cleansing, we learn gratitude.Thankful for all the people in this world tirelessly striving for life, it is you who light up the darkness, warm the cold, and fill this world with hope.

Each ordinary day is the most beautiful scenery of life, every footprint deserves to be chiseled in memory. You who continue to strive, are the greatest group of people in this world.Life is ever-changing, ups and downs unpredictable.

Only by remembering our original aspirations can we persist to the end. Let us join hands and move forward, lighting up the stars and sea of life together.
